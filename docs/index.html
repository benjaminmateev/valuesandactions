<p>In deep discussions with the group I was traveling in, on how we can take action after this educational trip, I started saying that I want to create a visual representation of my values and match them with how I make decisions and take action in my communities, with my family and my friends.</p>

</section><section>

<p>Being explicit about my values will help me be clear about my decisions and actions and will guide me through ambiguous and unkown situations and experiences and will help me stay true to myself. And this is where Sandbox comes in as well.</p>

</section><section>

<p>I am combining various ways of working out your values &amp; principles and making it into a workshop format to work out your own personal wheel of life. A visual representation of your values and how you can put them into action.</p>

</section><section>

<p>A workshop format for up to 10 people that will work through getting to know each other better, defining and understanding each others values better and coming up with ideas and actions how to better implement it in their life.</p>

</section><section>

<p>A workshop to create a visual representation that people can lean on, revisit and update throughout their life</p>
