# Hello Sandbox!

#### This is Benjamin, and I want to start with a little story about my last year.

## A few months ago I travelled to Ahmedabad in India. This is where I had a strong realisation.

This is Ahmedabad, a city in northern India

---

### I got the chance to visit Gandhi's ashram and see where he lived, meditated, talked with his followers and taught his learnings.

### As part of his learnings he created the "satyagraha", the idea of nonviolent resistance (fighting with peace). 

---

### Gandhi used the satyagraha throughout his work in India and South Africa as a guiding idea. The word is from the sanskrit words satya, meaning truth, and agraha, meaning insistence. 

---

### It goes beyond passive resistance. For Gandhi it was a moral force born of truth and love. Gandhi asked the followers of

### It became very clear that Gandhi had a strong set of values and principles that he based his life upon. I saw a visual representation of that called the wheel of life

### The Wheel of life was created by Vinobaji as a visual representation of Gandhis value set and how he chose what to work on and advocate for based on them while using this focus as continued support for his values

---

### Throughout my trip in India this wheel of life stuck with me. Gandhi had such a strong presence in his country and in the world and on further consideration

## This is when I realised that I have strong values but I have not put them consciously in perspective with my goals and everyday actions.

---

## "Every positive change in your life begins with a clear, unequivocal decision that you are going to either do something or stop doing something."

---

In deep discussions with the group I was traveling in, on how we can take action after this educational trip, I started saying that I want to create a visual representation of my values and match them with how I make decisions and take action in my communities, with my family and my friends. 

---

Being explicit about my values will help me be clear about my decisions and actions and will guide me through ambiguous and unkown situations and experiences and will help me stay true to myself. And this is where Sandbox comes in as well.

---

# I want to make it a workshop for Sandboxers

---

I am combining various ways of working out your values & principles and making it into a workshop format to work out your own personal wheel of life. A visual representation of your values and how you can put them into action. 

---

A workshop format for up to 10 people that will work through getting to know each other better, defining and understanding each others values better and coming up with ideas and actions how to better implement it in their life.  

---

A workshop to create a visual representation that people can lean on, revisit and update throughout their life

---

### My Wow is to commit to the Sandbox community to run a first version of this workshop in the next six months and if successful offer it on a regular base to the community while continuously refining it and revisit Sandboxers wheel of life as well.
